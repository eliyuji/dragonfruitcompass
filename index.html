    <h2>🍓 Why Dragon Fruit?</h2>
    <p>
      Dragon fruit, also known as <em>pitaya</em>, is a tropical cactus that produces one of the most
      stunning fruits in the world. With its vibrant pink or yellow skin, speckled white (or red) flesh, 
      and refreshing taste, it’s as beautiful in your garden as it is on your plate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond its looks, dragon fruit is packed with antioxidants, fiber, and vitamin C—making it a 
      powerhouse for your health. Best of all, with the right care, this hardy cactus can thrive right 
      here in California’s Bay Area climate.
